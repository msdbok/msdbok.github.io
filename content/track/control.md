# Controlling

## 1. Purpose of Controlling

Controlling is the active part of project management — it means taking action based on what tracking and reporting reveal.  
It’s how managers steer a project toward its goals, rather than merely observing or describing it.

Controlling answers the question:

> “What should we do about what we’ve learned?”

Key aspects of control include:
- Decision‑making: choosing how to respond to deviations.
- Correction: implementing actions to fix or prevent problems.
- Learning: using data to improve estimates, methods, and team behavior.

## 2. The Feedback Loop

Tracking, reporting, and controlling form a continuous feedback cycle:

| Stage     | Function                 | Output                     |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Tracking  | Collect data on current state | Facts and metrics      |
| Reporting | Communicate and interpret    | Insights and forecasts  |
| Controlling | Decide and act             | Adjustments and improvements |

The loop must be frequent and transparent — otherwise, issues grow faster than responses.

---

## 3. Corrective Actions

When tracking shows a deviation, managers can respond in several ways:

| Type of Deviation | Typical Actions |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Schedule delay    | Re-sequence tasks, fast-track, add resources, reduce scope |
| Cost overrun      | Re-estimate, optimize resource mix, re-scope noncritical features |
| Quality issues    | Pause for defect removal, strengthen reviews or testing |
| Scope creep       | Re-negotiate requirements, tighten change control |
| Team performance  | Coaching, reassignments, improve communication |

Control is not about punishment — it’s about recovery and learning.

## 4. Managing Baseline Changes

When the baseline plan becomes outdated, changes must be formalized and traceable:

1. Document the change — describe what and why.  
2. Identify source of funding — management reserve, new budget, or reallocation.  
3. Adjust the baseline — update scope, schedule, or cost targets.  
4. Maintain history — record the evolution.

Never change the baseline just to hide poor performance.

## 5. Control in Agile Projects

Control in Agile frameworks is embedded in iteration cycles rather than done periodically.

| Predictive (Plan‑Driven) | Agile (Iterative) |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Control via scheduled reviews and variance reports | Control via sprint reviews and retrospectives |
| Formal change requests | Continuous backlog refinement |
| Focus on variance from plan | Focus on adaptability and flow efficiency |

Agile teams use burndown charts, cumulative flow diagrams, and task boards for immediate, team‑owned control.

---

## 6. Visual Tools for Control

- Burndown charts: downward slope shows progress; flat/rising slope signals stagnation.  
- Task boards: highlight WIP and bottlenecks.  
- Cumulative flow diagrams: reveal congestion or healthy flow.

Visual control enables rapid feedback — the essence of agility.

## 7. Controlling Quality: Testing & Fixing

Key metrics and levers:
- Test coverage — are we validating enough?  
- Defect trends — improving or regressing?  
- Time‑to‑fix and reopen rate — fix efficiency and quality.

When defect rates rise, options include freezing new features, focusing on stabilization, or adding reviews.

---

## 8. Human Aspects of Control

Effective control involves people:

- Explain why corrective actions are needed.  
- Involve the team in deciding how to fix issues.  
- Balance accountability with psychological safety.

When control is punitive, teams hide problems; when collaborative, they surface them early.

---

## 9. Governance and Escalation

Control feeds into governance:

- Steering meetings review variances and approve changes.  
- Thresholds define when deviations are escalated (e.g., >10% overrun).  
- Lessons learned are logged for future improvements.

Control ensures alignment with organizational strategy.

---

## 10. Summary

Controlling closes the loop between tracking and planning: it transforms awareness into action.

| Step     | Purpose            | Outcome      |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| Tracking | Observe and measure| Facts        |
| Reporting| Communicate        | Understanding|
| Controlling | Decide and act  | Improvement  |

You can’t control what you don’t track — and tracking is pointless unless it leads to control.
