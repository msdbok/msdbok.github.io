# Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)

Goldratt applies his Theory of Constraints (TOC) to project management and presents the “critical chain” scheduling approach. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0263786399000198)

---

## 1. Background & Context

- TOC: Every system is limited by a few key constraints. 
- Goldratt extended TOC to project management; CPM often ignores resource limits. 
- In 1997, Goldratt introduced the “Critical Chain” method (CCPM).

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Critical Chain Definition

- The “critical chain” is the longest sequence of tasks considering both **task dependencies** and **resource constraints**. 
- CPM looks only at dependencies/durations; CCPM adds resource limits. 

### 2.2 Key Differences from CPM

- Traditional schedules pad each task for uncertainty, leading to “student syndrome” and Parkinson’s Law. 
- CCPM uses shorter, more aggressive durations and protects the schedule with buffers.
- Multitasking is discouraged; focus on one task at a time for critical resources.

### 2.3 Buffer Management

- **Project Buffer:** at the end of the critical chain, protects the finish date. 
- **Feeding Buffers:** where non-critical paths join the chain, protect against delays.
- **Resource Buffers:** ensure resources are ready for critical tasks.

### 2.4 Monitoring & Control

- Monitor buffer consumption, not just task deadlines. 
- Focus is on protecting the chain and finishing on time.

---

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. Define scope & build a task network (WBS).
2. Estimate realistic task durations (remove padding).
3. Assign and level resources; avoid multitasking.
4. Identify the critical chain.
5. Insert project, feeding, and resource buffers.
6. Execute and monitor buffer consumption.
7. Review and improve for future projects.

## 4. Benefits & Challenges

### 4.1 Benefits

- Handles resource constraints better.
- Can reduce project duration and improve reliability.
- Reduces multitasking and context-switching.
- Focuses on overall schedule protection.

### 4.2 Challenges

- Requires cultural change and buy-in.
- Needs accurate estimates and resource planning.
- May not suit all project types.
- May require new tools and practices.

| Item              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical Chain    | Longest sequence of tasks considering dependencies and resources.            |
| Buffers           | Time protection at project end, feeding paths, and resource readiness.       |
| Resource Leveling | Avoids over-committing critical resources.                                  |
| Monitoring        | Focuses on buffer consumption, not just task deadlines.                      |
| Goal              | Reliable, fast project completion by protecting the chain.                   |
