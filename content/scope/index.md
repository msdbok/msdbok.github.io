## Scope and Estimates

Defining project scope and making accurate estimates are two of the biggest challenges in engineering and project management. Scope sets the boundaries for what will be delivered, while estimates help teams plan resources, schedules, and budgets. Misunderstandings or changes in scope can lead to missed deadlines, cost overruns, and frustration for everyone involved.
