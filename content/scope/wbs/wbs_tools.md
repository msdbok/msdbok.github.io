# Brief Guide on WBS Tools
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) helps organize project work into manageable pieces. Here are some tools to help you build and visualize WBS and mind maps:

- **WBS Schedule Pro**: Dedicated WBS tool for creating charts and Gantt diagrams.
- **MindView**: Mind-mapping software with WBS and timeline features; integrates with MS Office.
- **Canva Whiteboards**: Visual, drag-and-drop whiteboard for brainstorming and custom diagrams.
- **Markdown Map / Markmap / MindMap AI**: Convert Markdown text into mind maps for quick visualization.
- **Obsidian (Canvas plugin)**: Note-taking app with spatial canvas for mapping ideas.
- **XMind / Whimsical / Logseq**: Mind mapping and knowledge tools with export options.

Choose a tool that fits your workflow—some are free, some offer advanced features for a fee. Most support exporting diagrams for reports or presentations.
