# Software Project Lifecycle Models – Overview

This page outlines seven widely used lifecycle models—**Waterfall, V-Model, Iterative, Incremental, Prototyping, RAD, Spiral**—what they are, why they’re useful, and when to apply them. A compact comparison table closes the page.

---

## Waterfall

**What it is.** A linear, once-through sequence (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Maintenance). Each phase is completed and signed off before the next.  
**Why it’s used.** Strong structure and documentation; predictable milestones and contracts. Limited adaptability: feedback arrives late and change is costly.

**Good fits (examples).**

- Stable, well-specified projects (e.g., fixed-scope government systems, regulated upgrades).
    
- Domains demanding documentation and stage gates (e.g., certain defense/legacy contexts).

## V-Model

**What it is.** A refinement of Waterfall pairing each development stage with a corresponding test stage (e.g., requirements ↔ acceptance test; design ↔ integration/unit).  
**Why it’s used.** Early test planning and traceability improve quality; still largely sequential and change-averse.

**Good fits (examples).**

- Safety-/mission-critical software where verification and validation are paramount (e.g., medical devices, avionics, automotive).
    
- Projects requiring end-to-end traceability from requirements to tests.

## Iterative

**What it is.** Build in repeated mini-cycles; reassess and refine requirements, design, and implementation each iteration.  
**Why it’s used.** High adaptability and continuous learning reduce late-stage surprises; needs scope discipline to avoid “endless iteration.”

**Good fits (examples).**

- Evolving or uncertain requirements; product and R&D work.
    
- Historic example: NASA Shuttle primary avionics—17 iterations over ~31 months to accommodate changing needs.

---

## Incremental

**What it is.** Deliver the system in **increments**—each a usable slice—until complete.  
**Why it’s used.** Early value and staged integration; can prioritize risky/valuable features first. Requires careful integration planning.

**Good fits (examples).**

- Large enterprise systems rolled out by module (e.g., core customer accounts → billing → reporting).
    
- MVP then progressive enhancements; standards historically allowed evolutionary/incremental builds (e.g., MIL-STD-498).

---

## Prototyping

**What it is.** Create quick, focused prototypes to clarify needs; either throw away (to refine specs) or evolve into the product.  
**Why it’s used.** Very fast feedback reduces requirements risk, especially for UX. Must manage expectations; prototypes may sidestep performance/security until later.

**Good fits (examples).**

- UI-intensive apps (mobile/desktop) where look-and-feel drives acceptance.
    
- Feasibility spikes for new algorithms or integrations; early client demos for complex business rules.

## RAD (Rapid Application Development)

**What it is.** Time-compressed, user-involved delivery in short cycles; heavy use of prototyping, component reuse, and small, focused teams.  
**Why it’s used.** Fast turnaround and continuous user input; less suitable for very large or safety-critical systems without added rigor.

**Good fits (examples).**

- Business applications with urgent time-to-value (e.g., call-center tools, internal dashboards).
    
- Process re-engineering efforts where users co-design workflows in workshops.

---

## Spiral

**What it is.** A **risk-driven** cycle: set objectives → analyze risks → engineer → evaluate; repeat, mixing methods as risks dictate.  
**Why it’s used.** Makes risk mitigation the central driver; highly adaptable but requires strong risk expertise and governance.

**Good fits (examples).**

- Large, complex, high-uncertainty programs (e.g., defense/aerospace platforms, platform modernizations).
    
- Projects needing phased “specify → prototype → evaluate → refine” with explicit risk burn-down.

Tip: In practice, teams often **combine** models (e.g., incremental delivery developed iteratively, with prototypes and spiral-style risk spikes). Choose the mix that fits **risk, volatility, compliance, and time-to-value**.
