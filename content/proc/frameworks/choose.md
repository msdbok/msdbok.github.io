# Choosing Your Software Development Process Framework

Selecting the right software development process framework is crucial for project success. This guide compares eight major frameworks—from heavyweight, plan-driven approaches to lightweight Agile methods—and provides practical decision guidance for MS students.

---

## Key Decision Criteria

When choosing a process framework, consider:

- **Team Size:** Small teams (XP, Scrum) vs. large/multi-team projects (SAFe, RUP).
- **Project Size & Complexity:** Large, complex projects need more structure (RUP, SAFe); small projects can use lightweight methods (Scrum, XP).
- **Risk Tolerance:** High-risk domains (TSP, RUP) require rigor; Agile methods (XP, Kanban) suit projects that can tolerate change.
- **Process Discipline:** Some frameworks require strict adherence (TSP, RUP); others rely on team self-discipline (Kanban, Lean).
- **Documentation Needs:** RUP and TSP require extensive documentation; Agile methods focus on working software.
- **Iteration Cadence:** XP uses short cycles; Scrum has fixed sprints; Kanban is continuous; RUP/SAFe have longer phases.
- **Customer Involvement:** XP and Scrum need frequent feedback; RUP/TSP involve customers at milestones.
- **Tooling:** Heavyweight frameworks need robust tools; lightweight methods can use simple boards or trackers.
