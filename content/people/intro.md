# Why do we need Management of Software Development?

## Why do so many projects fail?

The Standish Group CHAOS report (2015) claims:
- **19%** of projects failed outright
- **45%** were "challenged" (late, over budget, or missing key features)
- Only **36%** were successful  
For large-scale projects, the numbers are even worse: only **6%** succeed.

**Success**: Delivered on time, within budget, and with the required features  
**Failure**: Cancelled before completion, or delivered but never used  
**Challenged**: Late, over budget, and/or missing required functions

Despite decades of experience:
- CMU CS department is 60 years old
- UC Berkeley’s is 40 years old
- NASA has used software since the 1950s

Yet, software development remains unpredictable compared to other engineering disciplines.

## Few Thoughts

### Software is Different

- **Orders of magnitude complexity**: Software systems can be vastly more complex than physical systems.
- **Intangible**: You can't touch or see software; it's abstract.
- **Perceived as "soft"**: Easy to change, but changes can have unexpected consequences.
- **Abstraction**: Both the product and the process are abstract.
- **Stakeholder understanding**: Many stakeholders do not fully understand software or its development.
- **Uniqueness**: Every software project is different; there are few universal solutions.

> **Example Question:**  
> Can code written in BASIC and in C# compile to the same machine code?  
> *Answer: Yes, if both are compiled for the same architecture, but the process and efficiency may differ greatly.*

### The Human Variable

- **#1 problem for managers:** How to motivate people?
- **Standardization challenges:**  
    - Experience varies  
    - Abilities to learn and execute tasks differ  
    - Interpersonal relationships affect team dynamics
- **Unpredictability:** Human behavior is hard to predict and control.
- **First fit problem:** Matching people to tasks is rarely perfect.

### Constraining the Human Variable

- **Processes:**  
    - Define acceptable behavior norms  
    - Direct behavior and actions  
    - Standardize responses: "See A, do B" (first fit)
        - *Pitfall:* Over-standardization can lead to "assembly line" problems—loss of creativity and adaptability.
- **Process improvement:** Continuously refine how work is done.
- **Process checking:** Ensure processes are followed and effective.
- **Communication:** Historically, communication in software teams is poor, leading to misunderstandings and mistakes.

## Why Study Management of Software Development?

- To understand **why projects fail** and how to improve success rates.
- To learn how to **manage complexity** and **human factors**.
- To apply **engineering discipline** to software, while recognizing its unique challenges.
- To develop skills in **process design**, **team leadership**, and **effective communication**.
