# Teams Problems: Decision Making
_Adapted from David Root (2014)_

## Basics

### Decision Levels

- **Operational:**  
  Everyday decisions, often made quickly with little structure.  
  *Example:* Assigning today’s coding task or approving a pull request.

- **Tactical:**  
  Medium-term decisions that support strategy and direct resources.  
  *Example:* Choosing a testing framework for the project.

- **Strategic:**  
  Long-term decisions about direction, goals, values.  
  *Example:* Deciding to adopt Agile development across the organization.

### Major Problem – Analysis Paralysis

When teams spend too much time analyzing options, they fail to act.

- **Buridan’s Ass:** A paradox where too many choices prevent decision.
- **Focus on drawbacks:** Overemphasis on risks stalls progress.
- **Result:** Delay, lost opportunities, wasted energy.

---

### Basic Techniques

- **T-Chart (+/–):** Compare pros and cons.
- **SWOT Analysis:** Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
- **Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule):** Focus on the small % of causes that yield big results.
- **Pair-Wise Comparison:** Compare options against each other, one by one.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Compare expected gains vs. expected costs.

**Software example:** Pareto Analysis helps software teams find the few issues that cause most pain. For example, a team collects bug reports and measures user impact and frequency. Sorting defects by cumulative user-reported incidents reveals that 20% of bugs account for roughly 80% of errors and customer complaints. The team prioritizes those high-impact defects, fixes them, and reduces support load dramatically. Developers pair-code on the top items, add regression tests, and monitor metrics to confirm improvement. By focusing limited time on the critical minority, the team delivers faster value and frees capacity for new features and improves customer satisfaction each release.

### Decision Making Model

(*Source: Hoover et al, Evaluating Project Decisions*)

**Inputs**
- Problem (requirements, constraints)
- Assumptions
- Knowledge (facts, data)
- Experience (skills, intuition)

**Decision Process**
- Select and apply a decision technique (e.g., SWOT, cost-benefit).

**Outputs**
- Solution chosen
- Assumed risks documented

## Influencing Factors

### Decision-Driven Organizations

(*Source: Rogers & Blenko*)

- Some decisions matter more than others → focus on high-impact ones.
- Action is the goal (Standish Report).
- Ambiguity is the enemy → clarify.
- Speed & adaptability are crucial.
- Roles > org chart → empower decision-owners.
- Fear of overstepping must be overcome.
- Well-aligned organizations reinforce roles.
- Practice builds capability: “practicing beats preaching.”

**Core problem:**  
How much information is “enough” before deciding?

### Intuitive Decision Making

(*Source: Gary Klein, The Power of Intuition*)

- **Definition:** Translating experience into action, often without formal analysis.
- **Origins:** Firefighters, military, police — high-pressure environments.
- **Premise:** Intuition is a skill → can be built, applied, safeguarded.

**Advantages**
- Very fast, based on pattern recognition.
- Allows action under uncertainty and time pressure.

**Risks**
- Over-reliance on familiar patterns → blind spots.
- Experienced people can still make fatal mistakes (“Deep Survival” – Gonzales).
- Low risk ≠ no risk.

**Barriers**
- Rigid policies, remote/distributed teams, turnover, constant change.
- Procedures, metrics-driven culture, IT constraints.

### Theory of Thin Slicing

(*Source: Malcolm Gladwell, Blink*)

- **Definition:** Ability to make accurate judgments based on very small “slices” of information.

**Examples**
- **John Gottman’s Love Lab:** Predicting relationship success by coding emotional signals (SPAFF).
- **Military interceptors:** Interpreting Morse code patterns.
- **Medical research (Levinson, Ambadi):** Malpractice risk depends on *tone* and *empathy*, not just content.

**Key Point:**  
Thin slicing is part of human cognition, not a rare talent.

---

### Time and Decision Making

(*Source: Gary Klein*)

**Chess Experiment**
- Blitz vs. regular → skilled players made similar % of good moves.

**Observations**
- Skilled decision makers can make good choices even under pressure.
- Often their *first considered action* is already a good one.

---

### Group Decision Making

(*Source: Marlene K. Rebori*)

**Common outcomes in groups:**
- No decision (paralysis)
- Self-appointed decision maker
- Minority rule
- Majority rule
- Consensus

**How to choose method?**
- Based on timeliness, appropriateness, relationships.

**Problems in group decisions**
- Deciding too soon (rushing).
- Analysis paralysis (stalling).
- No clear criteria.
- Poor listening → debate instead of dialogue.
- Perceptions of unfairness.
- Groupthink / *Abilene Paradox* (agreement without real support).
