## Capturing & Tracking Risks

---

### Techniques & Process (“Capturing”)

- Use **formalized brainstorming** sessions: bring together diverse stakeholders, have prompts, facilitator/scribe/timekeeper.
- Employ **Software Risk Evaluation** (or similar moderated sessions) to systematically assess risk candidates.
- Use **taxonomy-based questionnaires** (risk categorization / checklists) to ensure coverage.
- Risk forms / templates: as soon as someone identifies a concern, fill out a risk form with _condition + consequence_.
- Ensure _everyone in any activity_ can identify and report risks—not only managers or formal roles.

---

### Assigning Responsibility

- Every risk should have an **owner**: someone with authority and resources to act. Without assignment, risks tend to be ignored.
- The owner must have:
    1. **Responsibility** – make sure tasks related to that risk are taken.
    2. **Authority** – ability to make decisions or escalate.
    3. **Resources / capability** to respond.
- For some risks, consider **transfer** (outsourcing, insurance, third parties). But even if transferred, you should still monitor it.

---

### Mitigation Strategies

- Must be **doable / realistic**: fit the project’s constraints (time, budget, people).
- Types of mitigation strategies:
    - **Prevention / avoidance** – eliminate the risk’s cause or reduce likelihood.
    - **Reduction / minimization** – lessen impact if risk occurs.
    - **Contingency planning** – what to do if risk becomes real.
    - **Training / skill building** – reduce risk by increasing team capability.
    - **Processes / procedural changes** – add reviews, checkpoints, quality gates etc.
    - **Awareness raising** – ensure people know about the risk so they can act.

---

### Tracking & Review

- Risks should be **reviewed periodically**, with frequency depending on project size, criticality, stability of environment.
- Remove risks that are no longer applicable (“no longer risks”, “obsolete”, or they’ve been resolved / mitigated).
- Identify which risks have become **issues/problems**.
- Monitor changes in priority, impact, or likelihood over time. Some risks decrease in impact / probability as mitigations take effect.
- Track mitigation strategy progress: Is the planned action done? Is it helping?

## Examples (Mitigation / Responsibility / Tracking)

|Example #|Condition|Consequence(s)|Possible Mitigation(s) / Assigned Owner / Tracking|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Ex 1**|There is a puddle of water on the floor.|‒ Carpet may be ruined  <br>‒ Someone may slip and get hurt  <br>‒ Equipment (electronic) may short out|**Mitigation**: Immediate cleanup; place warning signs; identify source of water leak and repair; have a policy for floor inspections.  <br>**Owner**: Facilities or safety manager.  <br>**Tracking**: daily checks until leak fixed; weekly inspections; log incidents.|
|**Ex 2**|Historically, project teams have lost a team member in the first 3 months.|Project scope, schedule, quality may/will change (disruption, knowledge loss)|**Mitigation**: Cross-training; knowledge documentation; backup staffing; hiring buffer; mentor pairing.  <br>**Owner**: Project manager / HR.  <br>**Tracking**: monitor staff turnover; early months stress; schedule risk reviews early.|
|**Ex 3**|The project requires the use of C# and no one on the team has experience with it.|Delays due to learning curve; bugs; lower productivity; possibly poor design decisions|**Mitigation**: Training; bring in consultant or hire someone with C# experience; pair programming; prototyping; allocate more time for development.  <br>**Owner**: Technical lead or engineering manager.  <br>**Tracking**: track learning progress; measure productivity; adjust schedule if needed; monitor code quality.|

## When & Where to Identify / Track & Where to Review

- **Anytime, anywhere**: as soon as there’s a concern, during any meeting / artifact review / design work.
- Use “statement of fact” style for capturing: helps avoid speculation / fuzzy language.
- Scheduled reviews: decide upfront (e.g. weekly for critical/high-risk projects, monthly for stable ones) and include them in project plan.
- Triggered reviews: after major changes (scope change, new technology, external event for project), after incidents, or after stakeholder feedback.
