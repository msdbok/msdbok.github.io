## 1. **Loyalists**

- **Who they are:**  
  Customers who are completely satisfied and keep coming back.
- **Impact on expectation management:**  
  - Foundation of long-term success.
  - Their expectations are well-matched to what the company delivers.
  - Includes **Apostles**—customers so satisfied they actively recommend the company.
  - **Management:** Maintain consistency, listen carefully, and exceed expectations, especially when recovering from failures.

## 2. **Defectors**

- **Who they are:**  
  Customers who leave after dissatisfaction, or even those who were once satisfied but had unresolved problems.
- **Impact on expectation management:**  
  - “Satisfaction” (e.g., 4 out of 5) is not enough; only _complete_ satisfaction ensures loyalty.
  - Includes **Terrorists**—angry defectors who spread negative word of mouth.
  - **Management:** Act early to identify and resolve dissatisfaction. Fast recovery and proactive communication are crucial.

## 3. **Mercenaries**

- **Who they are:**  
  Customers who may be completely satisfied but lack loyalty—often price-driven, impulsive, or trend-chasing.
- **Impact on expectation management:**  
  - Costly to serve and hard to retain.
  - High satisfaction does not guarantee long-term value.
  - **Management:** Don’t overinvest in this group; focus on segments where expectations and value align.

---

## 4. **Hostages**

- **Who they are:**  
  Customers who are dissatisfied but stay because they have no alternatives (e.g., monopolies, high switching costs).
- **Impact on expectation management:**  
  - Dangerous in the long run—if market conditions change, they will defect en masse, often becoming “terrorists.”
  - Consume resources and hurt morale through frequent complaints.
  - **Management:** Address dissatisfaction even if customers are “stuck,” as future competition can expose vulnerabilities.

## Implications for Customer Expectation Management

- Merely “satisfying” customers is not enough; aim for **complete satisfaction**.
- Different customer types require different strategies:
  - **Invest in Loyalists and Apostles:** Retain, delight, and empower them.
  - **Recover Defectors quickly:** Prevent negative perceptions from spreading.
  - **Avoid overcommitting to Mercenaries:** Focus on profitable, loyal segments.
  - **Manage Hostages carefully:** Anticipate competition and reduce frustration.
