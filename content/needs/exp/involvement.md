# Customer Involvement in Managing Expectations

**Source:** Heskett, Sasser & Wheeler, _HBR: Putting Customers to Work_ (2008)

---

## Why Involve Customers?

- Customers increasingly **shape the conversation** about brands and services.
- Involvement creates a sense of **ownership** and strengthens emotional attachment.
- Fully engaged customers drive **higher revenue, loyalty, and profitability** than disengaged ones.

---

## Forms of Customer Involvement

### 1. **Delivering Service**

- Customers participate in providing or co-producing the service.
- **Examples:**  
  - Self-service gas stations  
  - Airline self check-in  
  - Patients at Shouldice Hospital counseling each other and participating in recovery
- **Benefits:** Cost and time savings, increased control, and fewer unwanted interactions.

### 2. **Improving Products and Services**

- Customers contribute ideas, reviews, or corrections.
- **Examples:**  
  - Amazon product reviews  
  - Wikipedia editing  
  - IHG online customer community influencing service design

### 3. **Producing Personal Value**

- Customers take over activities that reduce costs and create experiences.
- **Examples:**  
  - IKEA effect: assembling your own furniture  
  - Build-a-Bear Workshop: customizing stuffed animals

### 4. **Sales & Marketing Participation**

- Customers act as **brand evangelists** or sales partners.
- **Example:**  
  - Karmaloop “street team” reps promoting products and designs created by customers

## Why Customers Participate

- **Importance of outcomes** (e.g., health recovery, personalized experiences)
- **Desire for control** over results and processes
- **Community pressure / mutual benefit** (e.g., Wikipedia, Angie’s List)
- **Distrust of intermediaries** (“customers do it better”)
- **Cost savings** (self-service)
- **Avoiding unwanted interactions** (self-checkout)

---

## Managing Customer Work

1. **Clarify objectives** – cost reduction, innovation, promotion, or feedback?
2. **Select the right customers** – usually the most engaged and motivated self-select.
3. **Train customers** – avoid frustration (e.g., Southwest Airlines Boarding School retrains flyers).
4. **Amplify and respond** – gather and act on feedback consistently.
5. **Establish recovery processes** – well-designed guarantees (e.g., Lands’ End unconditional return policy) can turn antagonists into loyal owners.

---

## Risks and What Can Go Wrong

- Mismanaging expectations can turn customers into **antagonists**.
- Overemphasis on marketing control instead of genuine participation damages trust.
- Failure to follow up on feedback undermines credibility.
- Involving the wrong customers (outside the target group) wastes resources.

---

## Targeting the Right Level of Involvement

- Balance **ownership and control**—not all areas should be open to customer influence (e.g., core product vision vs. incremental improvements).
- **Examples:**  
  - Sony kept tight control but observed users for insights.  
  - Intuit actively incorporated customer feedback in software updates.  
  - EMC convened customer councils for product roadmaps.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Customer involvement is **essential** for managing expectations and building loyalty.
- The right kind of involvement transforms customers into **partners** who co-create value.
- Companies must design involvement **strategically**, provide training, ensure responsiveness, and avoid “false” loyalty traps.
- Done well, involvement increases the **ownership quotient (OQ)**, turning satisfied customers into **committed advocates**.
