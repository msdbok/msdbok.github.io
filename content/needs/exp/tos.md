## Definition & Purpose

- The **threshold of success** (TOS) is a set of clear, pre-defined criteria that determine whether a project is considered successful.
- TOS is established **in advance** and used to evaluate project actions, decisions, and deliverables.
- Alternatively, you can define a **threshold of failure** (what must _not_ happen), then invert those statements to set your success criteria.
- TOS is a powerful tool for **managing stakeholder and customer expectations**—it clarifies up front what “success” means, reducing ambiguity and future disputes.

## Key Dimensions

When defining thresholds of success, consider these classic project management dimensions:

| **Dimension** | **What it addresses**                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**     | What will be delivered (features, functions)|
| **Time**      | Schedule, milestone dates                   |
| **Cost**      | Budget, financial constraints               |
| **Quality**   | Performance, reliability, usability, etc.   |

Thresholds should be **unambiguous** and stated as clear requirements in each area.

## How to Define a Threshold of Success

1. **Gather stakeholders**  
   - Include everyone affected: customers, users, team members, sponsors.
2. **Build a minimum picture of failure**  
   - Define what would make the project a failure (e.g., “delivered after date X,” “cost over Y,” “missing feature Z,” “quality below standard Q”).
3. **List failure statements**  
   - Collect unacceptable outcomes as negative statements.
4. **Invert to create success thresholds**  
   - Turn each failure statement into a positive, measurable success criterion (e.g., “delivered by date X or earlier,” “cost ≤ Y,” “includes feature Z,” “meets quality standard Q”).
5. **Apply SMART criteria**  
   - Make sure each threshold is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
6. **Set perception and credibility**  
   - Use these thresholds to establish your professionalism and reliability with stakeholders.

## How TOS Helps Manage Expectations

- **Clarity:** Everyone knows exactly what must be delivered, when, at what cost, and at what quality.
- **Alignment:** Reduces surprises and misunderstandings—expectations are explicit, not assumed.
- **Decision criteria:** Project decisions can be evaluated against the thresholds (e.g., “Does this change violate our cost threshold?”).
- **Negotiation tool:** If a change threatens a threshold, you can negotiate trade-offs based on the agreed criteria.
- **Perception management:** Being explicit about thresholds demonstrates professionalism and builds trust.

## Limitations & Challenges

- **Agreement:** Getting all stakeholders to agree on thresholds can be difficult due to differing priorities or hidden assumptions.
- **Conflicts:** Some thresholds may conflict (e.g., high quality vs. low cost vs. fast delivery vs. broad scope); trade-offs are often necessary.
- **Realism:** Setting thresholds too low (meaningless) or too high (unachievable) harms credibility.
- **Change management:** Project changes may require revisiting and renegotiating thresholds with stakeholders.
