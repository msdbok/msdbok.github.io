## 1. Why Setting Expectations Matters

- Customers often leave even when they say they are “satisfied.”
- The gap between _satisfied_ and _completely satisfied_ customers is huge in terms of loyalty.
- Managing expectations up front helps avoid disappointment, prevents miscommunication, and builds trust.

## 2. How to Set Expectations

### a. Evaluate the Client – Educate the Developers

- Understand the client’s background, company culture, and experience with vendors.
- *Example:* A client from a regulated industry (e.g., banking) expects precision and documentation. Developers must be aware of this context.

### b. Find a Common Language

- Avoid jargon and clarify terminology.
- *Example:* “Release” might mean “final delivery” to the client, but “deployment to test” for IT. Define terms early.

### c. Educate the Client

- Help clients understand trade-offs (scope, time, budget, quality).
- *Example:* If a new feature is requested late, explain its impact on deadlines and cost.

### d. Explain Processes and Standards

- Make decision-making, progress tracking, and quality validation transparent.
- *Example:* Use agile boards or review cycles to make progress visible.

### e. Good Enough vs. Perfect

- Clarify when a “fit-for-purpose” solution is acceptable versus when “perfection” is required.
- *Example:* A prototype for internal testing doesn’t need full security, but the final product does.

### f. Impact of Changes

- Clearly communicate how scope changes affect:
    - **Time** (delays)
    - **Budget** (extra costs)
    - **Quality** (possible compromises)
- *Example:* Adding a feature may delay delivery by two weeks.

### g. Impact of Evaluating Changes

- Teach clients that even _evaluating_ a change request takes time and effort.
- *Example:* Assessing a new vendor integration may require a week of investigation before a decision.

## 3. Setting Expectations in Practice

### a. Honesty

- **“Bad news doesn’t get better with time.”**
- Share issues early to build credibility.
- *Example:* If a key dependency slips, inform the client immediately rather than waiting until the deadline.

### b. What You Say vs. What You Do

- Consistency builds trust. Overpromising and underdelivering destroys it.
- *Example:* Don’t claim “system is 100% ready” if testing is incomplete.

### c. Attenuating Bad News

- Frame setbacks constructively: explain the issue, options, and mitigation.
- *Example:* “The supplier delay pushes us back 5 days, but if we drop Feature X, we can still meet the original date.”

### d. Don’t Forget Good News

- Clients need reassurance, not just crisis updates.
- *Example:* Share when milestones are reached early or when user feedback is positive. This strengthens confidence.

## 4. Examples of Good and Poor Expectation Management

| Scenario                        | Poor Practice                                 | Good Practice                                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New requirement late in project  | Accept silently, then miss deadline.          | Explain impact on budget and schedule; offer options.              |
| Defect discovered                | Hide it, hope client doesn’t notice.          | Report immediately, outline fix and prevention plan.               |
| Progress updates                 | Only deliver at final deadline.               | Provide weekly demos/reports.                                      |
| Language use                     | Developer jargon (“We’ll refactor monolith”). | Plain terms (“We’ll split the system into smaller, faster parts”). |
