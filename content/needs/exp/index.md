## Customer Expectations in Software Engineering

- **Agile Development:**  
  Customers often see Agile as _“pay as you go”_—they expect flexibility, adaptability, and ongoing collaboration.
- **Lowest Bidder:**  
  Even when choosing the lowest-cost provider, customers may still expect high quality and full-featured results.

## Perception of Value

- Customers ask: _“What makes this a good value?”_
- Value is **subjective** and can be difficult to define.
- A useful formula:

    $$
    \text{Customer Perception} = \frac{\text{Project Performance}}{\text{Expectations}}
    $$

    - **Key Point:** If expectations are set too high, even strong performance can feel disappointing.
- Customers may expect:
    - “New” or “cutting-edge” technology, even if it adds risk or cost.

## Takeaways

- Managing expectations is as important as delivering results.
- Understand that perceptions, not just facts, drive satisfaction.
- Set realistic, clear expectations and communicate openly to avoid misunderstandings.
