# Time Reporting System ‚Äî System Description
_Adapted from Eduardo Miranda (2014)_

## 1) Overall Context

The **Time Reporting System (TRS)** lets employees report hours worked against customer projects so customers can be billed. Hours are charged to **Pay Codes** (each Pay Code = unique _project + task_). Employees may only charge to Pay Codes for which they have a **charge authorization**.

Because many employees work at customer sites, TRS must support **remote access via web** with no local installs, and run seamlessly on **Chrome, Safari, and Firefox**.

To reduce misuse or tampering, access is **password-protected** and **Pay Code creation is separated from charge authorization**. Worked hours can be approved **only** by the supervisor who **created** the relevant authorization **or their delegate** (delegation is scoped to a specific employee).

Approved timesheets are exported to the **Payroll System**, which the organization uses for payroll and **downstream billing**.

## 2) System Context

**Purpose & scope.** The diagram shows the **TRS boundary**, the **human actors**, and the **two system-to-system interfaces**.

### 2.1 UML Use Case Diagram

  classDef actor fill:#fff,stroke:#555,stroke-dasharray:4 2
  classDef main fill:#fde68a,stroke:#b45309,stroke-width:3px,color:#111

  %% Human actors
  emp["üë§ Employee"]:::actor
  sup["üë§ Supervisor"]:::actor
  adm["üë§ Administrator"]:::actor

  %% External systems
  Perso["üóÑÔ∏è Personnel System"]:::actor
  Payroll["üí∂ Payroll System"]:::actor

  %% System boundary
  subgraph TRS["Time Reporting System"]
    useOperate(("Operate Time Reporting System")):::main
    ucEmpSync(("Synchronize<br>Employee<br>Data"))
    ucTsExport(("Export<br>Approved<br>Timesheets"))
  end

  %% Associations
  emp --> useOperate
  sup --> useOperate
  adm --> useOperate

  Perso --> ucEmpSync
  ucTsExport --> Payroll

  %% Show they are part of overall operation
  ucEmpSync --- useOperate
  ucTsExport --- useOperate

```

#### 2.2 Actors at the boundary

- **Employee** ‚Äî performs day-to-day time reporting.
    
- **Supervisor** ‚Äî creates charge authorizations, delegates approval, and approves timesheets.
    
- **Administrator** ‚Äî manages account access and the Pay Code catalog.
    
- **üóÑÔ∏è Personnel System (Perso)** ‚Äî inbound HR/master data for employees and reporting lines.
    
- **üí∂ Payroll System** ‚Äî receives **approved** timesheets for payroll and downstream billing.
    

#### 2.3 Information flow & boundary rules

- Direction on arrows indicates who initiates and where data goes (e.g., **Perso ‚ûú TRS**; **TRS ‚ûú Payroll**).
    
- Context-level only: internals (DB, screens, services) are out of scope here.
    

---

## 3) Time Reporting Subsystems

- **Access Control** ‚Äî login and RBAC; **Admin maintains**, **Supervisor/Employee consume**.
    
- **Pay Code** ‚Äî catalog of chargeable codes (project+task); **Admin maintains**.
    
- **Employee** ‚Äî employee reference data (incl. supervisor reporting line from Perso).
    
- **Charge Matrix** ‚Äî the **authorization map** (which employees may charge which Pay Codes); **Supervisors own** it.
    
- **Timesheet** ‚Äî employees enter/submit; supervisors approve/reject according to the Charge Matrix rules.
    

### 3.1 Operational story

1. **Admins** maintain Access Control and the Pay Code catalog.
    
2. **Supervisors** build the Charge Matrix (authorizations) and approve Timesheets they own (or via valid delegation).
    
3. **Employees** authenticate, see **only authorized** Pay Codes, and create/submit Timesheets.

## 4) Supervisor Functions

- **Login ‚Üí Access Control** ‚Äî RBAC is checked for supervisor capabilities.
    
- **Create/Delete Charge Authorization** ‚Äî grants/removes an employee‚Äôs ability to charge a Pay Code (project+task). The record is stored in the **Charge Matrix** and marked with **createdBy** (the owning supervisor).
    
- **Delegate Approval / Revoke Delegation** ‚Äî a supervisor may delegate **approval authority for a specific employee** to another supervisor for a validity window.
    
- **Approve Timesheet** ‚Äî approves/rejects employee Timesheets. Approval is allowed when the approver is **the Authorization.createdBy** **or** has a **valid Delegation** for that **employee**.
    
- **Supervisor Report** ‚Äî reports over authorizations and Timesheet status/activity.

**Approval policy for mixed Pay Codes.** Approvals are **per TimesheetRow** (per charged Pay Code). A Timesheet becomes **Approved** when **all** rows are approved; otherwise it remains **Partially Approved** or **Submitted** (policy name up to the team).

---

## 5) Employee Functions

- **Login ‚Üí Access Control** ‚Äî the employee authenticates.
    
- **Report Time** ‚Äî create time entries (date, Pay Code, hours, notes).
    
- **Modify Timesheet** ‚Äî edit Draft entries.
    
- **Submit Timesheet** ‚Äî move to **Submitted** for supervisor action (usually locks edits).
    
- **Recall Timesheet** ‚Äî move back to **Draft** (allowed **until any row is approved**).
    
- **Employee Report** ‚Äî personal summaries (hours by period/Pay Code, statuses).
    

### 5.1 Operational story

1. Employee authenticates.
    
2. Employee records time, with available Pay Codes filtered by the **Charge Matrix** (must be authorized).
    
3. Employee can modify until submission; after submission, they can **recall** (unless any row was already approved).
    
4. Employee may view reports at any time.
    

### 5.2 Timesheet lifecycle (policy)

  Draft --> Submitted : submit()

  Submitted --> Approved : all rows approved

  Approved --> [*]

## 6) Administrator Functions

Two areas, both gated by Login/Access Control:

1. **Employee account & access management**
    
    - **Grant TRS Account Access** (provision/activate account with role).
        
    - **Revoke TRS Account Access** (permanently remove access).
        
    - **Block Account** (temporary disable).
        
    - **Reset Password**.
        
2. **Pay Code catalog lifecycle**
    
    - **Create / Update / Delete Pay Code** entries used by other subsystems.
        

> Terminology: These are **account access** operations (not charge authorizations). Charge authorizations are in the Supervisor area via the **Charge Matrix**.
