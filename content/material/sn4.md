## 2. Reading Questions on WBS

### 2.1 “Advocating a Deliverable-Oriented Work Breakdown Structure” (Rad, 1999)

1. Why does Rad claim that the **WBS** is “the most difficult to define, and yet the most useful” of three core project structures: OBS, RBS, and WBS?
2. How does a **deliverable-oriented WBS** differ conceptually from a **schedule-oriented** or **resource-oriented** WBS?
3. In what ways does a deliverable-oriented WBS better reflect the **client’s perspective** and **project objectives** compared to traditional WBS approaches?
4. Rad lists several possible “division bases” for WBS decomposition (deliverable, product, functional system, physical area, etc.):
    1. Which of these bases are _deliverable-oriented_, and which are _means-oriented_?
    2. Why does Rad consider deliverable-oriented bases to be superior?
5. How might the **basis of division** affect the quality of project monitoring and reporting?
6. How could the deliverable-oriented approach be adapted for **agile**, **iterative**, or **research-driven** projects where deliverables evolve?

### 2.2 “Impact of Various Work-Breakdown Structures on Project Conceptualization” (Shlomo, 1994)

1. What is the main argument of Globerson’s paper about the relationship between a project’s WBS and its management approach?
2. The author calls the WBS the _“taxonomy of a project.”_
    1. What does he mean by this metaphor?
    2. How does this view differ from seeing the WBS as a simple task list?
3. Why does Globerson argue that **different WBSs for the same project** can lead to **different organizational structures and management styles**?
4. Globerson suggests that the WBS should be designed early but updated through **configuration management**. Why is this necessary, and what kind of “chaos” is he warning against?

## 3. Lecture Questions on Estimating

1. Estimation converts **scope** into what two dimensions? Define each.
2. Contrast **bottom-up** vs **top-down** estimation: process, strengths, weaknesses, and when to use.
3. Name the six categories of estimation approaches and give one real-world example for each.
4. What’s the general form of a **parametric model** (CER)? Identify the role of each term.
5. When are **counting approaches** preferable to analogy or judgment?
6. List four common cognitive biases that affect expert estimation and give a practical countermeasure for each.
7. Why can matching estimates (everyone picks the same number) in a Planning Poker round still hide disagreement?
8. Your org lacks historical data and requirements are incomplete. Which estimation categories would you combine and why?
9. A stakeholder fixes the total budget first. Which estimation path is implied, and how would you sanity-check it?
10. What enhancements does **Miranda (2008)** add to Planning Poker, and what problem do they address?
11. Why is Planning Poker a poor fit for architecture/infrastructure tasks? Propose an alternative for those items.

## 4. Reading Questions on Estimating

### 4.1 “Formal Models or Expert Judgment?” (Jørgensen & Boehm, 2009)

1. According to Jørgensen, what empirical evidence exists about the real-world use and accuracy of formal estimation models?
2. Why has the software industry shown limited adoption of formal estimation models despite decades of research and promotion?
3. Based on Table 1 in the paper, what are the main process differences between **expert-judgment-based** and **model-based** estimation?
4. How does each approach transform information into an effort estimate?
5. What types of information can expert judgment incorporate that formal models typically cannot?
6. Why does Boehm argue that formal models are valuable even when experts are available?
7. According to Jørgensen, what inherent limitations prevent formal models from outperforming expert judgment in many contexts?
8. What advantages does Boehm claim formal models provide in terms of risk analysis, sensitivity analysis, and trade-off evaluation?
9. Both authors agree that estimation accuracy is often poor. What reasons do they each give for this persistent problem?

### 4.2 “Fundamentals of Function Point Analysis” by David Longstreet

1. What problem does Function Point Analysis aim to solve in software measurement?
2. Why are function points considered _technology-independent_?
3. Explain how the five component types (EI, EO, EQ, ILF, EIF) differ in their role within a system.
4. What are the main benefits of using FPA for project management and estimation?
5. What are possible **limitations** of the FPA approach in modern software contexts (e.g., agile or cloud-based systems)?
6. How does FPA promote better communication between users and developers?

### 4.3 “Planning Poker” (Grenning, 2002)

1. What social or cognitive biases does Planning Poker mitigate, and how?
2. Why does Grenning argue for _less precision_ in release-level estimates?
3. How might Planning Poker complement — or conflict with — more formal methods like Function Point Analysis?
4. What mechanisms ensure that essential discussions still occur, despite the focus on speed?
5. How does the “game” aspect contribute to team engagement and learning?

### 4.4 Chapter 6: “Manual Software-Estimating Methods” from _Estimating Software Costs_ by Capers Jones

1. **Accuracy and Risk** – Why do manual estimates tend toward optimism?
2. **LOC vs FP** – What are the conceptual and economic weaknesses of LOC-based metrics?
3. **Function Point Rules** – Which of Jones’s FP-based exponents (e.g., 0.4 for schedule, 1.25 for defects) illustrate non-linear scaling?
4. **Activity-Based Costing** – How does ABC explain differences between civilian and military productivity?
5. **Reuse and Context** – Why can’t universal ratios or constants exist for software estimation?
6. **Modern Relevance** – How could Jones’s “manual” methods be adapted for Agile or component-based systems today?
