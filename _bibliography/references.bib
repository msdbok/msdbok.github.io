	abstract = {Although the agile software development approaches have gained wide acceptance in practice, the concerns regarding the scalability and integration of agile practices in traditional large-scale system development projects are prevailing. Scaled Agile Framework ({SAFe}) has emerged as a solution to address some of these concerns. Despite few encouraging results, case studies indicate several challenges of {SAFe} adoption. Currently, there is a lack of a well-structured gradual approach for establishing {SAFe}. Before and during {SAFe} adoption, organizations can benefit greatly from a uniform model for assessing the current progress, and establishing a roadmap for the initiative. To address this need, we developed a maturity model that provides guidance for software developing organizations in defining a roadmap for adopting {SAFe}. The model can also be used to assess the level of {SAFe} adoption. We took an existing agile maturity model as a basis for agile practices and extended it with practices that are key to {SAFe}. The model was developed and refined with industry experts using the Delphi technique. A case study was conducted in a large organization where we evaluated the model by applying it to assess the level of {SAFe} adoption. © 2016 The Authors.

Despite the growing adoption of various scaling agile frameworks, there is little empirical evidence of how effective their practices are in mitigating risk, especially in global software development ({GSD}), where project failure is a known problem. In this study, we develop a {GSD} Risk Catalog of 63 risks to assess the degree to which two scaling agile frameworks–Disciplined Agile Delivery ({DAD}) and the Scaled Agile Framework ({SAFe})–address software project risks in {GSD}. We examined data from two longitudinal case studies implementing each framework to identify the extent to which the framework practices address {GSD} risks. Scaling agile frameworks appear to help companies eliminate or mitigate many traditional risks in {GSD}, especially relating to users and customers. However, several important risks were not eliminated or mitigated. These persistent risks in the main belonged to the Environment quadrant highlighting the inherent risk in developing software across geographic boundaries. Perhaps these frameworks (and arguably any framework), would have difficulty alleviating, issues that appear to be outside the immediate control of the organization.},

Objective: The aim of this work is to identify commonalities of existing Scaling Agile Frameworks concerning their practices. Method: We extracted and consolidated the practices of twelve frameworks and compared the frameworks based on their practices using a visualization. Results: Frameworks prescribe scaling practices as well as practices on team level. There are practices common to most frameworks like the scaled Scrum events, e.g., a scaled planning meeting or retrospective.

	abstract = {Following the highly pervasive and effective use of agile methods at the team level, many software organisations now wish to replicate this success at the organisational level, adopting large-scale agile methods such as {SAFe}, Scrum-at-Scale, and others. However, this has proven significantly challenging. An analysis of the extant literature reveals a disparate set of studies across each individual method, with no cross-method comparison based on empirical evidence. This systematic literature review compares the main large-scale agile methods, namely {SAFe}, {LeSS}, Scrum-at-Scale, {DAD}, and the Spotify model. It is the first study to analyse and compare each of the method’s principles, practices, tools, and metrics in a standardised manner. For each method, it presents not just the original method specifications but also all extensions and modifications to each method proposed by subsequent empirical research. It includes in this comparison not just commercial large-scale methods but also those that have been custom-built in organisations such as Nokia, Ericsson, and others. Based on the findings reported in this study, practitioners can make a more informed decision as to which commercial method or method component or, indeed, custom-built method is better suited to their needs. Our study reveals a number of theoretical and practical issues in the current literature, such as an emphasis on the practices of commercial frameworks at the expense of their underlying principles, or indeed any of the custom method. A set of challenges and success factors associated with the use of large-scale agile methods are identified. The study also identifies a number of research gaps to be addressed across methods.},

This work employs a qualitative approach supported by an exploratory analysis that identifies and explores the processes of migration to a large-scale agile. In the first phase, fifteen assessment criteria for scaling agile are discussed. In a second phase, these criteria are used to perform a comparative analysis of six large-scale agile frameworks (i.e., {DAD}, {LeSS}, Nexus, {SAFe}, Scrum at Scale, and Spotify). The findings reveal there isn't a dominant large-scale agile framework in all dimensions. However, it is possible to identify frameworks like Nexus and Spotify that target smaller teams and offer low technical complexity. These frameworks easily accommodate changes, while there are other frameworks like {SAFe} and {DAD} that offer high levels of scalability but require more demanding and deep efforts in changing work processes in an organization.},

This includes crucial activities such as estimating the effort required to develop the software project, creating a software project schedule including allocation of human resources, managing project risks, monitoring progress, etc. Inadequate handling of such activities can thus lead to serious consequences to software companies. However, software project management is also a very challenging task that involves multiple business and human factors, and conflicting objectives. These challenges are exacerbated when dealing with medium- to large-size software projects. Under such circumstances, artificial intelligence has the potential to play a significant role in supporting software project managers, enabling them to make more informed management decisions.

	abstract = {In an economy driven by ideas and intellectual know-how, top executives recognize the importance of employing smart, highly creative people. But if clever people have one defining characteristic, it's that they do not want to be led. So what is a leader to do? The authors conducted more than 100 interviews with leaders and their clever people at major organizations such as {PricewaterhouseCoopers}, Cisco Systems, Novartis, the {BBC}, and Roche. What they learned is that the psychological relationships effective leaders have with their clever people are very different from the ones they have with traditional followers. Those relationships can be shaped by seven characteristics that clever people share: They know their worth--and they know you have to employ them if you want their tacit skills. They are organizationally savvy and will seek the company context in which their interests are most generously funded. They ignore corporate hierarchy; although intellectual status is important to them, you can't lure them with promotions. They expect instant access to top management, and if they don't get it, they may think the organization doesn't take their work seriously. They are plugged into highly developed knowledge networks, which both increases their value and makes them more of a flight risk. They have a low boredom threshold, so you have to keep them challenged and committed. They won't thank you--even when you're leading them well. The trick is to act like a benevolent guardian: to grant them the respect and recognition they demand, protect them from organizational rules and politics, and give them room to pursue private efforts and even to fail. The payoff will be a flourishing crop of creative minds that will enrich your whole organization.},

This growing awareness, that “good teamwork” increases the success of innovative projects, raises new questions: What is teamwork, and how can it be measured? Why and how is teamwork related to the success of innovative projects? How strong is the relationship between teamwork and various measures of project success such as performance or team member satisfaction? This article develops a comprehensive concept of the collaboration in teams, called Teamwork Quality ({TWQ}). The six facets of the {TWQ} construct, i.e., communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion, are specified. Hypotheses regarding the relationship between {TWQ} and project success are tested using data from 575 team members, team leaders, and managers of 145 German software teams. The results of the structural equation models estimated show that {TWQ} (as rated by team members) is significantly associated with team performance as rated by team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. However, the magnitude of the relationship between {TWQ} and team performance varies by the perspective of the performance rater, i.e., manager vs. team leader vs. team members. Furthermore, {TWQ} shows a strong association with team members' personal success (i.e., work satisfaction and learning).},

	abstract = {This history column article provides a tour of the main software development life cycle ({SDLC}) models. (A lifecycle covers all the stages of software from its inception with requirements definition through to fielding and maintenance.) System development lifecycle models have drawn heavily on software and so the two terms can be used interchangeably in terms of {SDLC}, especially since software development in this respect encompasses software systems development. Because the merits of selecting and using an {SDLC} vary according to the environment in which software is developed as well as its application, I discuss three broad categories for consideration when analyzing the relative merits of {SDLC} models. I consider the waterfall model before the other models because it has had a profound effect on software development, and has additionally influenced many {SDLC} models prevalent today. Thereafter, I consider some of the mainstream models and finish with a discussion of what the future could hold for {SDLC} models.},

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing for Requirements Engineering ({NLP}4RE) is an area of research and development that seeks to apply natural language processing ({NLP}) techniques, tools, and resources to the requirements engineering ({RE}) process, to support human analysts to carry out various linguistic analysis tasks on textual requirements documents, such as detecting language issues, identifying key domain concepts, and establishing requirements traceability links. This article reports on a mapping study that surveys the landscape of {NLP}4RE research to provide a holistic understanding of the field. Following the guidance of systematic review, the mapping study is directed by five research questions, cutting across five aspects of {NLP}4RE research, concerning the state of the literature, the state of empirical research, the research focus, the state of tool development, and the usage of {NLP} technologies. Our main results are as follows: (i) we identify a total of 404 primary studies relevant to {NLP}4RE, which were published over the past 36 years and from 170 different venues; (ii) most of these studies (67.08\%) are solution proposals, assessed by a laboratory experiment or an example application, while only a small percentage (7\%) are assessed in industrial settings; (iii) a large proportion of the studies (42.70\%) focus on the requirements analysis phase, with quality defect detection as their central task and requirements specification as their commonly processed document type; (iv) 130 {NLP}4RE tools (i.e., {RE} specific {NLP} tools) are extracted from these studies, but only 17 of them (13.08\%) are available for download; (v) 231 different {NLP} technologies are also identified, comprising 140 {NLP} techniques, 66 {NLP} tools, and 25 {NLP} resources, but most of them—particularly those novel {NLP} techniques and specialized tools—are used infrequently; by contrast, commonly used {NLP} technologies are traditional analysis techniques (e.g., {POS} tagging and tokenization), general-purpose tools (e.g., Stanford {CoreNLP} and {GATE}) and generic language lexicons ({WordNet} and British National Corpus). The mapping study not only provides a collection of the literature in {NLP}4RE but also, more importantly, establishes a structure to frame the existing literature through categorization, synthesis and conceptualization of the main theoretical concepts and relationships that encompass both {RE} and {NLP} aspects. Our work thus produces a conceptual framework of {NLP}4RE. The framework is used to identify research gaps and directions, highlight technology transfer needs, and encourage more synergies between the {RE} community, the {NLP} one, and the software and systems practitioners. Our results can be used as a starting point to frame future studies according to a well-defined terminology and can be expanded as new technologies and novel solutions emerge.},

Thus, the {WBS} designer already has a significant impact on the way that a project is to be managed at the very early stage of proposal submission, sometimes without being aware of it. A mismatch between the project {WBS}, the organizational structure, and the management style of the project manager has a negative impact on the likelihood of the project being completed successfully.

Measurement supports creating a corporate memory and is an aid in answering a variety of questions associated with the enactment of any software process.

According to many studies made on the application of metrics and models in industrial environments, measurement in order to be effective must be. Focused on specific goals Applied to all life-cycle products, processes, and resources Interpreted on the basis of characterization and understanding of the organizational context, environment, and goals This means that measurement must be defined in a top-down fashion. It must be focused, based on goals and models. A metric-driven, bottom-up approach, will not work because there are many observable characteristics in software (e.g., time, number of defects, complexity, lines of code, severity of failures, effort, productivity, defect density). A context specific selection of metrics and guidelines on how to use and interpret them should be made, based on the appropriate models and goals of that environment. The most common and popular mechanism for goal-oriented software measurement is the Goal Question Metric approach which is presented in this article in combination with examples from {GQM} application in industry},

	abstract = {Emotional Intelligence-the ability to manage one and their relationships effectively-consists of four fundamental capabilities self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and social skill. This chapter provides six styles of leadership. They are coercive leaders, authoritative leaders, affiliative leaders, democratic leaders, pacesetting leaders, and coaching leaders. Coercive leadership has a damaging effect on the rewards system. Most high-performing workers are motivated by more than money–they seek the satisfaction of work well done. The coercive style erodes such pride. Authoritative leadership maximizes commitment to the organization's goals and strategy. By framing the individual tasks within a grand vision, the authoritative leader defines standards that revolve around that vision. Affiliative leaders are masters at building a sense of belonging. They are, for instance, likely to take their direct reports out for a meal or a drink, one-on-one, to see how they're doing. They will bring in a cake to celebrate a group accomplishment.},

	shorttitle = {Evaluating Project Decisions},
	abstract = {Effective decisions are crucial to the success of any software project, but to make better decisions you need a better decision-making process. In  Evaluating Project Decisions , leading project management experts introduce an innovative decision model that helps you tailor your decision-making process to systematically evaluate all of your decisions and avoid the bad choices that lead to project failure.   Using a real-world, case study approach, the authors show how to evaluate software project problems and situations more effectively, thoughtfully assess your alternatives, and improve the decisions you make. Drawing on their own extensive research and experience, the authors bridge software engineering theory and practice, offering guidance that is both well-grounded and actionable. They present dozens of detailed examples from both successful and unsuccessful projects, illustrating what to do and what not to do.     Evaluating Project Decisions  will help you to analyze your options and ultimately make better decisions at every stage in your project, including:   Requirements–Elicitation, description, verification, validation, negotiation, contracting, and management over the software life cycle  Estimates–Conceptual solution design, decomposition, resource and overhead allocation, estimate construction, and change management  Planning–Defining objectives, policies, and scope; planning tasks, milestones, schedules, budgets, staff and other resources; and managing projects against plans  Product–Proper product definition, development process management, {QA}, configuration management, delivery, installation, training, and field service  Process–Defining, selecting, understanding, teaching, and measuring processes; evaluating process performance; and process improvement or optimization  In addition, you will see how to evaluate decisions related to risk, people, stakeholder expectations, and global development. Simply put, you’ll use what you learn here on every project, in any industry, whatever your goals, and for projects of any duration, size, or type.},

This study consults the {CCPM} literature in an inductive manner in order to investigate the status of ongoing research on {CCPM}, identify the approaches taken by researchers and their contributions, and suggest areas for future research. The main aim is to describe the current status of research on {CCPM} and explore {CCPM} aspects that require more research in the future. This study covers 140 journal and conference papers written on {CCPM} through an “exhaustive with selective citation” approach identified through online and reference searching. Those papers are categorised into six groups of introductory, critical, improving, empirical, case-reporting and exploiting papers based on their positions on {CCPM}, using the “hierarchical coding” method. As the result of this research, the current status of research on {CCPM} is critically reviewed and 21 potential areas of {CCPM} for future investigations are recommended as a major contribution.},

	isbn = {978-0-201-62432-8},
	shorttitle = {Case Method Fast-Track},
	abstract = {From the Book: In writing this book I tried to achieve two different objectives. The first objective was to provide an overview of fast-track, the techniques it applies, and particularly the management challenges it presents. The second objective was to provide a handbook for project managers running fast-track projects. Putting these together might have endangered the second, and more pragmatic objective. This I did not want to do, so the book is split into two distinct parts. Chapters 1 to 3 deal with fast-track in general, Chapter 4 to 7 deal with the life-cycle of a project in more detail, identifying the tasks and their deliverable, the techniques and the tools that support them. These later chapters refer back to the relevant sections of the first part of the book so the descriptions of specific techniques are all gathered together in Chapter 3 and not scattered and duplicated through subsequent chapters. I hope that this structure will mean a casual reader can gain an understanding of the fast-track approach quickly from the first part of the book, and the practitioner can have an organized and compact reference for daily use from the second part. In assembling the second part I frequently found myself adding an extra step or an additional task, for completeness. The result is that, while not all projects will need every step of every task, they are all necessary under some circumstances. Every task is included in a project on the basis of what it produces. If a particular project has no need of the result, for example, documentation of test results, then it should not be produced and the task should be omitted. During the initial planning of a project the template project plan offeredin Chapters 4 to 6 should be assessed and tailored for the project, cutting out the unnecessary tasks and steps. Do not be afraid to prune. The questions to ask are: "Do I need this deliverable to manage the project " and "Does the sponsor value this deliverable above its price " I have used Oracle tools throughout in examples, and in particular I have recommended an approach that exploits the ability of the Oracle {CASE} tools to define rules once then reuse them many times. Some {CASE} tools do not exploit reusability in this way, but the trend in development technology is towards greater reusability so it seems very appropriate here. Dai {CleggJuly} 1994},

	abstract = {To achieve higher flexibility and to better satisfy actual customer requirements, there is an increasing tendency to develop and deliver software in an incremental fashion. In adopting this process, requirements are delivered in releases and so a decision has to be made on which requirements should be delivered in which release. Three main considerations that need to be taken account of are the technical precedences inherent in the requirements, the typically conflicting priorities as determined by the representative stakeholders, as well as the balance between required and available effort. The technical precedence constraints relate to situations where one requirement cannot be implemented until another is completed or where one requirement is implemented in the same increment as another one. Stakeholder preferences may be based on the perceived value or urgency of delivered requirements to the different stakeholders involved. The technical priorities and individual stakeholder priorities may be in conflict and difficult to reconcile. This paper provides (i) a method for optimally allocating requirements to increments; (ii) a means of assessing and optimizing the degree to which the ordering conflicts with stakeholder priorities within technical precedence constraints; (iii) a means of balancing required and available resources for all increments; and (iv) an overall method called {EVOLVE} aimed at the continuous planning of incremental software development. The optimization method used is iterative and essentially based on a genetic algorithm. A set of the most promising candidate solutions is generated to support the final decision. The paper evaluates the proposed approach using a sample project.},

We interviewed 40 employees and found that most had been in situations where they were concerned about an issue but did not raise it to a supervisor. Silence spanned a range of organizational issues, with several of our respondents indicating that they did not feel comfortable speaking to those above them about any issues or concerns. The most frequently mentioned reason for remaining silent was the fear of being viewed or labeled negatively, and as a consequence, damaging valued relationships. From our data, we develop a model of how the perceived consequences of voice contribute to silence, and a model of how the social and relational implications of speaking up can take away employees’ ability to have influence within an organizational setting.},

	abstract = {For a decade following World War {II} social psychologists tended to view the individual as an element in a larger system. Research on small groups prospered, and attitudes and social perceptions were conceived to be antecedents and consequences of group activity. But by the 1960's social psychology had become much more individualistic. Interest in the group as a system had waned and research was generally focused on intraindividual events or processes that mediate responses to social situations. We now appear to be passing through a period of transition during which both the content and methodology of past research are being re-evaluated, and from which new trends are likely to emerge. Possible explanations of the changing orientation of social psychology are discussed, and predictions are advanced concerning future developments. It is suggested that social psychologists are responsive to the mood of the times, and that recent social and political unheavals presage a revival of the collectivistic approach.},

	abstract = {In social psychology, social loafing is the phenomenon of a person exerting less effort to achieve a goal when they work in a group than when working alone. It is seen as one of the main reasons groups are sometimes less productive than the combined performance of their members working as individuals.
Research on social loafing began with rope pulling experiments by Max Ringelmann, who found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone. In more recent research, studies involving modern technology, such as online and distributed groups, have also shown clear evidence of social loafing. Many of the causes of social loafing stem from individual members' feeling their individual effort will not matter to the group. This is seen as one of the main reasons groups are sometimes less productive than the combined performance of their members working as individuals, but should be distinguished from the accidental coordination problems that groups sometimes experience.
Several studies found the most prevalent motivational origins of social loafing to be the lack of an understanding of individual contributions, unchallenging tasks given to the individual, low personal satisfaction from the task, and lack of a united group. Theories investigating why social loafing occurs range from group members' feeling that their contributions will not be noticed to group members' realizing their efforts are not necessary. In a work setting, most managers agree if a task is new or complex that employees should work alone, while tasks that are well-known and have room for individual effort are better when done in groups.
In order to diminish social loafing from a group, several strategies could be put forward. Social loafing primarily happens when an individual unconsciously or consciously exerts less effort due to a decrease in social awareness. In order to counteract the likelihood of this happening, Miguel Herraez conducted a study on students where he used accountability and cooperation when unequal participation is found. The students were encouraged to provide equal participation in the work and to point out sources of conflict that could arise. The conclusion of the study found that providing support to the group members lacking in commitment and creating options for independence among group members lowered social loafing. The support for the weaker students improves their standing while also benefiting the other students.},

Plan-driven developers must also be agile; nimble developers must also be disciplined. The key to success is finding the right balance between the two, which will vary from project to project according to the circumstances and risks involved. Developers, pulled toward opposite ends by impassioned arguments, ultimately must learn how to give each value its due in their particular situations. Balancing Agility and Discipline sweeps aside the rhetoric, drills down to the operational core concepts, and presents a constructive approach to defining a balanced software development strategy. The authors expose the bureaucracy and stagnation that mark discipline without agility, and liken agility without discipline to unbridled and fruitless enthusiasm. Using a day in the life of two development teams and ground-breaking case studies, they illustrate the differences and similarities between agile and plan-driven methods, and show that the best development strategies have ways to combine both attributes. Their analysis is both objective and grounded, leading finally to clear and practical guidance for all software professionals--showing how to locate the sweet spot on the agility-discipline continuum for any given project.},

	isbn = {978-0-07-707843-0},
	abstract = {From the Publisher:System Requirements Engineering presents a balanced view of the issues, concepts, models, techniques and tools found in requirements engineering research and practice. Requirements engineering is presented from business, behavioural and software engineering perspectives and a general framework is established at the outset. This book considers requirements engineering as a combination of three concurrent and interacting processes: eliciting knowledge related to a problem domain, ensuring the validity of such knowledge and specifying the problem in a formal way. Particular emphasis is given to requirements elicitation techniques and there is a fully integrated treatment of the development of requirements specifications through enterprise modelling, functional requirements and non-functional requirements.},

	abstract = {Size and productivity are commonly cited as the two major software development cost drivers. Logic dictates that the two are related and inversely correlated. But what is the probabilistic range of uncertainty for productivity, given a software size? What is meant by “an 80\% confidence level for productivity”? Cost analysts often quantify uncertainty with an S-Curve; why can’t this be done for productivity directly? We use International Software Benchmarking Standards Group ({ISBSG}) data to estimate the distribution of productivity directly and provide closed-form formulas for the fitted distribution(s). We find that productivity (and, with certain assumptions, cost) can be estimated with an {SCurve} directly, using built-in Excel formulas, with no need for Monte Carlo simulation. This result has significant implications for almost any software development cost estimate and is particularly relevant to agile development efforts where time-boxed effort is generally fixed.},
