### Objective

These course notes aim to:
- Provide a structured and accessible overview of Managing Software Development topics.
- Equip readers with insights that bridge theory and real-world application.
- Encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the software development community.

**Approach:**  
- Focus on breadth over depth, introducing a wide range of concepts and practices.
- Present current and leading industry techniques, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
- Emphasize understanding the differences between approaches, rather than immediate mastery.
- Encourage critical thinking:
    - Reason about which techniques to apply in different contexts
    - Justify your choices with clear arguments
    - Explicitly state your assumptions, based on available facts

Our goal is to help you build a foundation for making informed decisions in software development management.
