### 2. Remove Corrupted References from Content

The following citations should be removed from content files as they are corrupted:

### 3. Manual BibTeX Mappings

The following citations have been manually mapped to their correct BibTeX keys:

| Citation | BibTeX Key | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|

| `005` | `humphrey_team_2000` | SEI document by Humphrey |
| `CMU / SEI's work on risk (e.g., CMU/SEI-99-TR-029)` | `carnegie_mellon_university_software_engineering_institute_continuous_1999` | CMU/SEI risk management |
| `IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications` | `ieee_computer_society_ieee_1998` | IEEE standard |
